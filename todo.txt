# TODO: Central buffer (broadcasting capability, mutlithreaded, define frequency)
# Define reading frequency --> python is sampling the sensor at that frequency
# Buffer should be of size 1
# TODO: Recording from interface (add groups)
# TODO: Multi OS support (Windows, Linux, MacOS), Maybe just open PR
# TODO: User should be able to call self defined workloads (e.g. NN or pixel tracking), talk to Simon
# Saving must be multithreaded (maybe without central buffer?)
