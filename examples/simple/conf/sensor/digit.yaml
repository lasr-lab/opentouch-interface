# Mandatory
sensor_type: "DIGIT"            # Sensor type. Use DIGIT here.
sensor_name: "First Gripper"    # Name of the sensor (can be arbitrary)
serial_id: "D20804"             # Serial ID of the Digit sensor

# Optional
intensity: 15                   # Brightness of the LED lights. Integer in the range of 0 to 15. Default is 15.
resolution: "QVGA"              # Resolution of the retrieved image. Can be either VGA or QVGA. Default is QVGA.
fps: 60                         # Frame rate at which the sensor samples data. Can be either 30 or 60. Default is 60.
stream: "FRAME"                 # Which data stream should be retrieved? Default is FRAME.
recording: False                # Weather the data is recorded when calling show(). Can be either True or False. Default is False.
path: "recording.h5"            # File path where recorded data is written to. Must be a .h5 file. By default, a random name is generated.
sampling_frequency: 30          # Frequency (Hz) at which the interface requests new data from the sensor. Default is 30.
recording_frequency: 30         # Frequency (Hz) at which data is recorded. Default is sampling_frequency. Can't be higher than sampling_frequency
